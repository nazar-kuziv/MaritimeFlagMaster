# MaritimeFlagMaster
An interactive desktop application for sailors and enthusiasts to master the International Code of Signals.

## Project Description
MaritimeFlagMaster is a dedicated desktop application designed to demystify and teach the International Code of Signals (ICS), a critical communication system used by sailors and maritime enthusiasts worldwide. The traditional method of learning signal flags can be a difficult and time-consuming process, relying on static charts and rote memorization. This challenge often presents a barrier to entry for new learners and a point of frustration for those seeking to refresh their knowledge.

This project was built to address that exact problem. By creating a modern, interactive platform, MaritimeFlagMaster transforms the learning process into an engaging experience. The application provides a comprehensive digital dictionary of all 26 international flags, along with their associated meanings and pronunciations. Its core value, however, lies in its interactive learning modules, which include a configurable quiz engine to test and reinforce knowledge in real-time. This dynamic approach makes mastering the ICS more accessible and efficient for everyone from casual learners to seasoned mariners.

The application is built with a focus on simplicity and performance, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. It serves as a testament to the power of combining traditional knowledge with modern desktop development tools to create effective and educational tools for a global community.
