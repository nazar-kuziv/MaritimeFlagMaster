GOODNESS IS THE ONLY INVESTMENT THAT NEVER FAILS
THERE IS NO PATH TO PEACE PEACE IS THE PATH
NO ONE HAS EVER BECOME POOR BY
LIFE HAPPENS IN THE RIVER NOT THE SHORE
THE SOUL IS NEITHER BORN AND NOR DOES IT DIE
BLOOM WHERE YOU ARE PLANTED
LIFES TOO MYSTERIOUS TO TAKE TOO SERIOUS
THE BEST WAY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IS TO CREATE IT
IM AN OPTIMIST BY CHOICE NOT BY STUPIDITY
MANS CHARACTER IS HIS FATE
DO NOT REGRET THE PAST LOOK TO THE FUTURE
NO MAN BECOMES RICH UNLESS HE ENRICHES OTHERS
LIFE IS A JOURNEY NOT A DESTINATION
WHATEVER HAPPENS ALWAYS HAPPENS ON TIME
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ARE THE HARDEST TO SAY
EVERYTHING THAT IRRITATES US ABOUT OTHERS
CHOOSE TO BE OPTIMISTIC IT FEELS BETTER
LIFE IS A BALANCE OF HOLDING ON AND LETTING GO
THE COST OF LEADERSHIP IS SELFINTEREST
LIFE IS A CONSTANT SERIES OF OPPORTUNITIES
THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THROUGH
IF FEAR IS TOO STRONG THE GENIUS IS SUPPRESSED
EVERYTHING HAS BEAUTY BUT NOT EVERYONE SEES IT
CEASE STRIVING THEN THERE WILL BE TRANSFORMATION
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERENT AFRAID
